      <left><h2><center>GENDER TRANSFORMATIVE STANDARD</center></h2> <p>The self-assessment tool is designed to help offices gauge the understanding and implementation of gender at the programmatic and organizational levels.The questionnaires used for the self-assessment signify the minimum standards for the offices at Action Against Network. <br>
The questionnaires are divided into two sections, including programmatic and organization, responded to by a country office to determine the level of GTA integration in their work. 
	A country office focal point, preferably a CEO (Chief Executive Officer) or Country Director, completes the questionnaire in a participatory manner, e.g., in a meeting collaboratively with other team members. 33 questions are responded to determine the results. Based on the results obtained, the office is determined to hire an expert to support the gender mainstreaming efforts of the office to advance toward a gender-transformative organization and program.
