      <left><h2><center>GENDER TRANSFORMATIVE STANDARD</center></h2> <p>The self-assessment tool is designed to help offices gauge the understanding and implementation of gender at the programmatic and organizational levels. While it clarifies key areas for focus around a Gender Transformative approach, it should not be used as an absolute measure or substitute for professional advice or guidance. The results from using this tool are intended to serve only as indicators that may require further investigation by qualified personnel to ensure the effective implementation of GTS standards.
